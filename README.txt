Stop wasting time scrolling up the page, now you will have the product update/publish button floating, draggable and at hand on your page.

== Description ==

**Floating Product Publish Button for WooCommerce** enables seamless, efficient updates, reducing the time spent and increasing your productivity!
This plugin has the function of making the product's publish/update button **floating and draggable**, so that you no longer waste time scrolling up the page.
All you have to do is scrolling down the product-edit page and the button(s) will *magically* appear at the bottom of the page in a central position so it can be easily reached **anywhere on the page**, so you *no longer have to scroll up* to find it.
Furthermore, in case the button(s) position is not optimal for your site, you can always move it: to do so, you simply have to perform a *drag*, i.e. click on the button and move it without releasing the mouse click, and once it is in the position you prefer, you just have to release the click and the button(s) *will remain in that position*.
On mobile, the button(s) will always simply appear at the bottom of the screen, right at your fingertips, ready to create your new product!
With the *latest update*, it will also be possible to set by default your **ideal buttons position**, and also to **customise the styles** (the color and background color are alternated in the Publish and Save Draft buttons, so that they are *immediately distinguishable*).
